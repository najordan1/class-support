## How to run the app:
  - ```cd``` into both the ```vue-app``` and ```back-end``` directories and run ```npm install```
  - In one terminal window, ```cd``` into ```vue-app``` and run ```npm run serve``` to build a development app
  - In another, ```cd``` into ```back-end``` and run ```node app.js```
  - To test if they're running correctly:
      - Front-end: open a browser tab and navigate to localhost:8080
      - Back-end: open another browser tab and navigate to localhost:3030
